# Discord Server Best Practices
This guide contain best practices that should be incorporated on every public Discord server. Many existing public communities incorporate various aspects from these guidelines.

**1. Server Icon**: This is a must for a server as it differs a server from others.
> • This can be an icon relating to your server or a logo.\
> • Observe the icon's copyright and license - make sure you can use it for your server.\
> • Added bonus if it's custom made.


**2. A Staff Team**: A staff team's job is to work on your server. 
> • Staff will help moderate to make sure everyone is following your server rules and [Discord's Terms](https://discord.com/terms).\
> • You should be quite selective of who can become staff on your server. Don't hire someone with a history of raiding and destroying other servers.\
> • You should run background checks on your staff members and reach out to references and see if your staff member is a good fit for your server.\
> • Your staff should be active in your server and should seem like a great role model to the rest of your members.


**3. Information Categories**: Your server should have an information category that contains your servers most important channels - in read only mode.
> • `Information/Welcome` - Used for information, for example the servers purpose and outside links as well as staff info.
> • `Rules` - A list of rules that are to be followed in your server. This channel should be set as your server's [rules channel](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server#:~:text=how%20to%20enable%20your%20community%20server) if your server is a [Community Server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server).\
> • `Announcements` - Used to display important updates in your server (such as if a new policy is being enforced or a general announcement). If your server is a [Community Server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047132851-Enabling-Your-Community-Server), you can [turn on the announcement channel feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032008192-Announcement-Channels-).\
> • These are standard channels usually found in an information category, but you can tweak these for your server as you wish.


**4. Moderation Bots**: In some cases, automation is needed to assist moderators with their daily tasks.
> • Moderation bots are important as they can help stop spam, monitor the chat for certain words, and much more in under a fraction of a second.\
> • Moderation bots should __not__ replace human moderators. They are meant as assistants to your moderation crew.\
> • A bot like [Dyno](http://dynobot.net) is recommended for your server as it's trusted by so many others - both large and small.\
> • You can find other trusted bots like Dyno on [Discord Bot List](https://discordbots.org/tag/moderation).


**5. Verification Levels**: The verification level system is a built in Discord feature which aids in preventing unwanted people from entering.
> • It is highly recommended that you have a verification level of __at least__ `LOW` or higher.\
> • For Community Servers, you cannot have anything below the `LOW` setting.\
> • It's recommended that you have a verification level of either `MEDIUM` or `HIGH`.\
> • For a squeaky clean shine, you can set your verification level to `VERY_HIGH`, but be mindful that not a lot of Discordians have verified phone numbers.


**6. Explicit Content Filter**: The explicit content setting is another feature built in to Discord. This prevents any NSFW content from being sent in non-marked channels.
> • This feature only scans messages in __un-marked__ channels. The feature is turned off in NSFW channels.\
> • In Community Servers, this feature __must__ be on at its maximum setting.\
> • We highly recommend you have this switched on to its maximum setting for a squeaky clean shine.


**7. Default Notifications**: Default notifications determine the notifications a member will get from your server (be that an in-app notification or a push notification).
> • For smaller servers, you can have it on it's default setting of `All Messages`, but it's not recommended.\
> • It is highly recommended that you set it to **only @mentions** as it will stop people from getting a notification everytime someone sends a message.\
> • For Community Servers, the setting must be switched to `only @mentions`.


**8. AFK Voice Channel**: These channels remove inactive people from voice channels to keep everything in order.
> • If your server has voice channels, you should consider setting up an AFK channel for inactive people.\
> • If they are deemed inactive (which is an automatic process by Discord), they will be automatically moved to that channel.\
> • This feature is perfect for keeping your voice channels clean from inactive people.


**9. Bot Logs**: Bot logs log all actions in your servers to help you and your mods keep track of everyone.
> • These logs can log events such as when a member joins and leaves your server as well as when they update their nickname or username and avatar.\
> • These logs can also log message events, such as messages being deleted and messages being edited.\
> • This is useful for auditing and evidence.\
> • Many major moderation bots such as Dyno offers this and you can select what you would like it to log.

**10. Default Permissions**: Only select the crucial permissions for the default `@everyone` role.
> • The everyone role should only be able to `SEND_MESSAGES`, `CONNECT`, `USE_EXTERNAL_EMOJIS`, `ADD_REACTIONS`, `EMBED_LINKS`, `ATTACH_FILES`, `SPEAK`, `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY`, `CREATE_INVITES`, and `CHANGE_NICKNAME`.\
> • For stricter servers, you can disable the permission to `CHANGE_NICKNAME` to enforce a naming system.\
> • The `@everyone` ping should be disabled for normal members. This permission must be switched off for Community Servers.


**11. Discord Guidelines**: You, your staff, your members, and your servers __must follow__ Discord's Guidelines.
> • Your server must follow [Discord's Terms](https://discord.com/terms).\
> • Your server must follow [Discord's Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).\
> • You must uphold both the Terms and Guidelines. For example, is someone DM advertises, you must ban them as "unsolicited advertising" is a violation of the Terms of Service.\
> • On top of this, it is your responsibility to uphold various other parts of the terms, such as but not limited to correctly flagging inappropriate channels as NSFW. 


**12. Staff Channels**: You should have hidden channels so your staff can communicate behind the scenes and privately.
> • You should have __private__ staff channels that allow your staff to discuss private matters without everyone seeing the messages.\
> • You can discuss confidential matters about others in said channels.\
> • Bot logs (as mentioned earlier), should be privatized in these staff channels as well.\
