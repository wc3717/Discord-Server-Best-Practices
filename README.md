# Discord-Server-Best-Practices
Best things to do when making a server. This is a guide on things that are good for when working on and creating a server.

**1. A Server Icon**: This is a must for a server as it differs a server from others. This could be an icon relating to your server or a logo.

**2. A Staff Team**: A staff team's job is to work on your server. For example staff will help moderate to make sure everyone is following your server rules and the [Discord ToS](https://discordapp.com/terms).

**3. A Information Catogory**: Your server should have a catogory with channels like
- Information/Welcome - Used for information, for example the servers purpose and outside links as well as staff info.
- Rules - A list of rules that are to be followed in your server. (eg. No spam)
- Announcements - When important things happen this is where you post them.
These are the main ones but if you want to put more in it is up to you.


**4. A Moderation Bot**: Your server should have a moderation bot like [Dyno](http://dynobot.net) or another one which can be looked for on [Discord Bot List](https://discordbots.org/tag/moderation). With bots like Dyno you should enable auto mod which means the bot will automatically stop spam and other things that may go against your rules.


**5. Verification Levels**: Your server should have a verification level set to stop unwanted people from entering. It is suggested to set to at least half way.


**6. Explicit Content Filter**: The Explicit content filter will stop NSFW content and content that goes against Discord ToS from being sent. 


**7. Defult Notifications**: Your server's defult notifications should be set to **Only @mentions** which will stop new people from getting a notification everytime someone sends a message.


**8. AFK Voice Channel**: If your server has voice channels you should have a AFK channel setup to help keep the Voice Channels clean from inactive people.


**9. Bot Logs**: Your server should have logging setup for events like member leaving and joining as well as message deletion etc. Dyno offers this and you can select what you would like it to log.

**10. @ everyone Permissions**: The everyone tag should only be able to speak, connect to VC, use externam emotes, add reactions, embed links, attach files, send messages, read message history, change nickname, create invite and any others that you may see. The everyone tag should be disabled for pinging by normal members.


**11. Discord ToS**: Your server should follow all aspects of Discord's ToS for example banning DM Advertisers and Spammers. Your server should also follow the ToS by labling channels if they are NSFW and other things that are said in the ToS. 


**12. Staff/Secret Channels**: You should have seperate channels for bot commands so your main channel does not get clogged up. You should also have a staff chat where you can talk to your staff about server related business. Sometimes it can also be better if you set up a seperate staff server for your staff, this is especially handy if you have a main server which has a lot of channels.

**13. Partnership Categories**: Partnerships are a great way to reach out to other related servers, it is useful to have a category for partnerships which includes a partnership requirements channel, a small partners channel, a medium partners channel and a large partners channel. 

**14. Channel Navigation Channel**: The purpose of this channel is to help new members navigate their way around your server. To make a channel navigation channel, all you need to do is list your channels which you have and give a short description of how they are to be used. It is also worth mentioning "Channels which require special roles are not shown"
